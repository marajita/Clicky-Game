# Getting Started
This app is a front-end game built with React.js. The user's goal is to click on each anime card only one time. There are 15 total cards that shuffle automatically on each click, making it more difficult for the user to remember which cards they have not clicked. After each click the cards shuffles. If user clicks on the anime card that they have clicked before, it will trigger an end game condition. If they have not, it will increase the current score.
